Skills for the future - What skills does an AI Robotic Engineer requires ? Whoever tells you RPA (Robotic Process Automation) deserves to get shot =)

The purpose of the article is to give the readers a glimpse of what kind of skills are needed for the future in the area of robotics and AI.  The perspective of AI is discussed together with an example of robotics by NParks for a social distancing “dog” to a prototype that I developed to uncover the various skills needed for this kind of future.  Knowledge will only grow more complex.  But you will need certain foundation.  A moral principle then becomes, if it’s not AI, let’s not call everything AI.

I love the [simple flow chart from MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/11/10/139137/is-this-ai-we-drew-you-a-flowchart-to-work-it-out/) on how you define Artificial Intelligence.  The mumbo you get when every vendor jumps on the AI wagon and says they are doing Artificial Intelligence.  Anything complex should be made simple. And this flow chart is simple. Actually, computer visioning and image processing is technically not AI,  AI is more than computer visioning. 

#  The foundation of Self driving cars and CCTV human recognition

From cameras tracking humans to self driving cars, a large part must be the image processing capabilities to “recognize” images such as another car or obstacle, human, etc and upon detection do something with the data, it could be to steer the vehicle to avoid these obstacles or to send the data to another subsystem, trigger voice to warn people to wear masks, maybe even to drop a payload by a drone when an enemy commander is detected.   They all involve a few aspects – Hardware and Software Integration.   In the past, these disciplines are all quite specialized and involved lots of “software codes”.   With “libraries”, there is still some programming needed.  The realms of knowledge increases with each sub-specialty.  It’s like asking a brain surgeon to do an open heart surgery or a Japanese chef to cook Hainanese Chicken Rice. There could be basic foundations to learn, but the deeper the specialization, the harder it is to “copy” without being experimental.
